## You30fps

Trying to make a Safari extension that forces YouTube to serve 30fps videos, for old Macs.

***NOT WORKING*** right now. Work in progress that maybe will work... eventually.

Using a [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) [script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/23329-disable-youtube-60-fps-force-30-fps) by SteveJobzniak. The script works, using the Tampermonkey extension, so go with it if you want.
